I've always been enamored with Austen-style literature since my school days. Titles like _Pride and Prejudice_, _Sense and Sensibility_, and _Jane Eyre_ transported me into a fantastical world filled with charming chit-chats, afternoon tea time, Christmas special plum cake, and shepherd's pie. It was a time when romance blossomed through witty conversations and clever remarks.

Imagine my delight when I stumbled upon webtoons set in that era. Two notable mentions are _The Lady and the Abbott_ (which I'll discuss another time) and _Lady Liar_.

I absolutely adore Maripaz Villar, the author of both series. She effortlessly brings readers into the era through her simple yet captivating drawings and stories, leaving you craving for more.

I won't delve too deeply into the plot because that's not my focus here.

Instead, I want to talk about the portrayal of the lead man, Bertran, in the series.

Bertran is portrayed with a refreshing realism. He is endearing but not considered a proper gentleman like his cousin, Oliver. He spends his days idly traveling with artists and authors, accepting his role in society as someone who isn't particularly serious. He also accepts his mother's decision to marry a rich heiress to maintain his lifestyle.

Bertran lacks confidence and often self-deprecates, possibly because he isn't as accomplished as his wealthier cousin. His mother doesn't believe in him, and neither does he.

However, we see a different side of him when he meets and falls in love with Adara. It doesn't take long to realize they are meant for each other. Adara unknowingly encourages him to continue and work on his writings, giving him the confidence to start publishing his work. He becomes ready to get a job, work, and take control of his own life.

In a romantic webtoon, having a male lead who isn't a perfect 6-foot gentleman and sometimes responds sarcastically is a rare find, a real man. Readers love him and happily root for him and Adara.

I appreciate characters who aren't perfect but grow into better versions of themselves. Even in a whimsical romance series, this kind of character development is the way to go for me. I can't wait to see how the story unfolds in future episodes!
