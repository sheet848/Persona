Yes. This is my blog logging my fitness journey which I have been working on since the last month.

I started intermittent fasting and calorie deficit diet from February 2025, 
and then I included exercise to go along with it starting this month (March 2025).

## Current Progress

This is the progress of about  **15 days**.

**Previous Weight**: 62 kgs ( 01/03/25 )

**Current Weight**: 59 kgs ( 14/03/25 )

**Wohoo!!**
I am so happy that my dietary changes and exercises have started working so fine for me. 
Less but more healthy food choices at home are making me fuller than ever. 
I didn't shy away from eating junk food but I noted down the calories rigorously and always checked how it affected me. This forced me to choose a less calorie junk that makes me fuller.

I can see visible changes in my **thigh gap area** and **upper body**.
I have stronger calves and doing squats have never been easier. I think that's my favourite exercise routine.
I feel like I have more energy to spend than before. In the beginning, it was hard doing the whole workout in one go. Now I feel more at ease.

Thanks [@Hailey](https://www.youtube.com/@HaileyC.) . She is such a life saver.
Her workouts are less strenuous. They don't make me too tired, and I am able to continue with my other commitments in life. Something which I can continue for the rest of life.

## Moving Forward

The days ahead look a bit tougher, since I will be even more busy after Holi but I will be continuing on this path for the new me and give more achievable success in the coming weeks.
