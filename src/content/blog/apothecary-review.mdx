There has been a huge influx of Shonen and slice of life because that's where the money comes in. And I was worried about the utter lack of Shoujo romances in the recent years. 
I almost thought, 

`Is the idea of a flowery romance and drama sort of dead?`

Just add some elements of infatuation and drama for the feel of it in the series and that's it.

But than The Apothecary Diaries came in and quickly became the talk of the Anime World. I couldn't wait any longer to binge on the series - `It is currently ongoing, though`

The series is about Maomao, a girl who works in her adopted father's apothecary until she is kidnapped and sold to the Rear Palace (where the concubines reside) as a servant girl. 
She tries to keep a low profile but her better judgement and intellect, also her knowledge about medicine draws attention of the nobles to her. 

There isn't a quite path to where this story is going - but as each episode runs a pattern about Maomao solving mysteries, a bigger underlying plot about the royal dynasty comes up, though very very slowly.

There are many things I like about this series. 

As we are watching the series from majorly Maomao's point of view. She is a practical young woman and doesn't like to falter into the emotional details of any situation she encounters. 

Just like her, the story likes to be in the present, and doesn't delve too much into the past emotionally to make the audience sympathize, just the crux of the situation is enough. 

Like when we get to know about the story of her parents, who were separated for 18 years. She states the situation as mere facts. 

That's probably how she had been brought up, despite the love and care of her courtesan sisters, the old lady manager and her adopted father. She learned to mature up quite early in life in contrast to Jinshi who is rather spoiled and childish at times despite being an intelligent levelled head ennuch.

The world building and the heavy themes shown in the series, are also regarded as something which occurs often. Just regarded as the way of their world by the characters. And this is how it is. The most realistic portrayal indeed. 

The Emperor's concubines' statuses which are marked by their physical assets and the children they bore for him. The hundreds of concubines who are forced to be virgins their whole lives despite the Emperor not giving them any attention.
Or how the courtesans value drops to zero with just a single mistake. Or how easy it was for people and even parents to sell off young girls to the Rear Palace to earn some money. It looked like the most blatant form of human trafficking which even the royalty approved of.

The most entertaining part for me personally - is when Maomao explains about poisons and how it could affect the human body. From her we realize how ordinary looking food and spices can turn poisonous under conditions.

I never knew honey is harmful for infants, and I had to look into it online - 

> Babies under 12 months old should not be given honey because it can contain spores of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which can cause infant botulism.
> Infant botulism is a rare but serious condition that affects the nervous system and can lead to muscle weakness, poor sucking, a weak cry, constipation, and decreased muscle tone.
> In severe cases, it can cause paralysis of the diaphragm, making it difficult for the infant to breathe.

And also Maomao's dynamics with characters in the series - Jinshi and Gao Shun.

Gao Shun is the perspective and loyal attendant to Master Jinshi. He is like a fatherly presence around Maomao. Although he is a grandfather at just 37 years old. He is always a little perturbed when both his master and the apothecary are casually bantering at each other since they both are young and of similar age.

You can find him indicating Maomao at times to speak and react more politely to his master which gives away the fact that Jinshi is an important person indeed.

With Jinshi. If I had to phrase it in a one liner - 

> They are like Tom and Jerry.

I can't stop laughing whenever they both are present on screen. But this is like a sub plot for the series. Not really something to ponder over when big matters are at hand.

It is one of the rare Shoujo anime with a well fleshed out story line, all characters are level-headed and not over the top. Even the side characters are well written. The goofy humor in the anime is well-placed. 
The opening song choreography "“Hana ni Natte” (meaning “Becoming a Flower”) by Ryokuoushoku Shakai" is executed beautifully. I love to capture every frame of it.

Overall this series is a good watch in my view. Can't wait for the new episode to be available already....
