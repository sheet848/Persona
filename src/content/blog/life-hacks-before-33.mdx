I am writing this principles and hacks, to remind myself I have to continue work and move forward. I am 26 so I am hopefully not to late either :

1. The person you are today depends largely on the **Books you read**, the **PEOPLE you see**, the **food you consume** and the **HABITS you adopt**.
2. If you want to improve at anything, the first step is **tracking your progress**.
3. If you genuinely want something, the least you can do is **ASK FOR IT**. You either get it or you don't, meaning you **either succeed** or **you build resilience**.
4. Always practice reflecting on the **GAIN** and not the **GAP**.
5. 80% of your day-to-day problems can be solved with a hard workout, a walk in nature, and a good night's sleep.
6. You should **always FILL YOUR OWN CUP** before you start trying to pour into someone else's.
7. **MANIFESTATION is real**; set ambitious goals, be positive about tough challenges and practice self-affirmation.
8. The **4-Quarters Rule** - Don't let a bad morning ruin your day. Instead, see each day as 4 Quarters:  _Morning - Midday - Afternoon - Evening_
9. If you want to smash a big goal, use the **90/90/1 Method** : use the first 90 min of your day, for 90 days towards 1 Main Focus. No interruptions and NO excuses.
10. **Prioritize saying "no"** to things that aren't your priority. Whether it's friends, family or business; never let others' priorities trump yours.
11. Have a simple yet **POWERFUL MORNING ROUTINE**. Don't check your phone  when you wake up, get outside into daylight and drink a pint of water.
12. Stop trying to find balance with everything. **ACCEPT** that life is imbalanced by its nature and that's OKAY.
13. Money should never be the goal. For true fulfilment, prioritize a healthy sustainable journey of **CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT**.
		_( I don't agree with this 100%. Money is an important goal. It gives you the means to achieve peace and fulfillment if you are not vain.)_
14. **Disconnect regularly**. Go for a tech free walk everyday in NATURE.
15. The **3-2-1 Rule for better sleep** :
	1. No food 3 hours before sleep
	2. No drink 2 hours before sleep
	3. No screens 1 hour before sleep
16. Use the 2 minute rule for **productivity**; if a task takes less than 2 minutes, just get it done now.
17. Create an **Anti to-do list** in order to consciously avoid bad habits, actions, or counterproductive thoughts.
18. Utilize the **80:20 rule in LIFE and BUSINESS**. Know that 20% of your actions will result in 80% of your results.
19. Consistently **seek Feedback, Keep it, and implement it regularly**. Growth compounds rapidly.
20. Use the **5/25 Rule** - write down 25 goals, circle the most important 5 and start working on them. The other 20 are distractions.
21. Take **task batching** -  group similar tasks together and complete them in one go. For e.g.: Emails and admins.
22. Don't try to blend in with others. Being **DIFFERENT** or **WEIRD** is your superpower.
23. You don't always have to see everything through. If you don't like a job, a book, a movie or a business, **learn when it's best to quit**.
24. Consume content at **1.5x speed**. This will speed up the whole learning process. If takes a while to get used to but its's so worth it.
