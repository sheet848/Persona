title: "JavaScript Across Borders - How the World Builds the Web in 2025"
publishedAt: "2025-04-06"
summary: "This write-up explores global trends in JavaScript usage based on data from BuiltIn.com, analyzing how different countries approach web development. While jQuery still dominates due to legacy usage and widespread adoption in platforms like WordPress, modern developers increasingly prefer native JavaScript and frameworks like React. Notable regional differences highlight the unique preferences of countries like China (Vue), Japan (Google Hosted Libraries), and Columbia (React-first). The piece also reflects on the author's personal journey transitioning from jQuery to modern tools."

I got a look on an interesting website today....

[builtIn.com](https://builtwith.com/)

Here, I can check technological profiles of any websites, web apps or web platforms I would like to. They release a concise report with just enough details. For more detailed information, there is always a paid option.

So a section of this website, includes trends in web technology people from all over the world are using to build these websites.

There is some very interesting observations -

## The Entire Internet

The whole of the internet majorly still uses jQuery, closely followed by JavaScript, React. Since Intersection Observer is a browser API mandatory applied to every website you are bound to visit.

jQuery has been considered obsolete since¬†around 2017,¬†as modern browsers and native JavaScript APIs began to offer functionalities that jQuery provided, making it redundant. 

Despite this, jQuery remains widely used, particularly in legacy projects and platforms like WordPress, where it is included by default. 

However, its usage has been declining, especially among newer developers who prefer modern frameworks like React and native JavaScript.

According to this website, they have analyzed 433,197,213 websites overall on the internet.

## India

  alt="Javascript trends of India"
  width={640}
  height={500}
/>

Similar expected trend, almost double the sites are created with jQuery as using with React and native JavaScript, which running the course together at the same pace.

This actually reminds me, at 2020, when I started out as a front end developer. I worked with jQuery briefly in 7-8 projects before switching to native JavaScript.

They have analyzed 8,937,351 websites for this.

## United States

<Image

  alt="Javascript trends of USA"
  width={640}
  height={500}
/>

The country with the most websites - 100,418,675.

Here, we see a change, jQuery though being the most used, the percentage of usage is quite less. While use of native JavaScript and React is way lower.

Use of service workers is higher - more focus in the US is on PWA (Progressive Web Apps).

## Russia

<Image

  alt="Javascript trends of Russia"
  width={640}
  height={500}
/>

Use of jQuery is way higher, and native JavaScript looks much more in use with React slower approaching.

## Japan

<Image
  src="/photos/japan-internet.png"
  alt="Javascript trends of Japan"
  width={640}
  height={500}
/>

From this data, looks like Japan still likes to use jQuery extensively with Google Hosted Libraries (GHCL) which is free and open source to add and host popular JS libraries.

Preference of downloading and hosting libraries is lower, just linking directly to the Google servers, does the job well for them.

And as expected use of native JavaScript or even is React is way lower than I found in other countries.

## South Korea

<Image

  alt="Javascript trends of South Korea"
  width={640}
  height={500}
/>

South Korea shows a similar trend as in Japan, with the use of frameworks not very popular. And more focus is on jQuery and native JavaScript.

## China

<Image

  alt="Javascript trends of China"
  width={640}
  height={500}
/>

China is another anomaly in this list. The use of jQuery is way higher than the other countries discussed here, almost 29%. With native JavaScript has the first runner up.
But when it comes to web frameworks, Vue is more popular than React.

## Columbia

<Image
  src="/photos/columbia-internet.png"
  alt="Javascript trends of Columbia"
  width={640}
  height={500}
/>

Columbia developers have fully and completely adapted to React framework with native JavaScript close behind. jQuery here looks a bit obsolete.

# Conclusion

Despite being "outdated" in modern dev workflows, it's still deeply embedded in **legacy systems, enterprise apps, and CMS platforms** like WordPress ‚Äî and as the data shows, it's _everywhere_, just hiding in plain sight.

A few fun takeaways from what you shared:

### üß™ Global Trends

- **jQuery still rules** the majority ‚Äî mostly because of legacy inertia.
    
- **React and native JS** are the go-to for modern devs and new projects.
    
- **Intersection Observer** being baked into browsers makes it ‚Äúunseen but everywhere.‚Äù
    
- **Service Workers** (especially in the U.S.) signal a growing interest in PWAs and offline-capable apps.
    

### üåè Regional Standouts

- **China** loves **Vue** ‚Äî probably due to its simplicity and community-driven localization.
    
- **Japan & South Korea** relying heavily on **GHCL** is a neat insight ‚Äî it reflects trust in CDNs and preference for straightforward solutions.
    
- **Columbia** going full React is a cool signal of modern adoption.
    
- **India** echoes a solid mix of legacy and modern ‚Äî exactly how it feels when working with real-world clients there.
