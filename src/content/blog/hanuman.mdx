For an Indian who grew up listening to the Ramayan and Mahabharat, there are always some theories and text dissections of the Valmiki's or Tulsidas's Ramayan which always brings new food for thought on the table.

Here, I header one such thing - which never left my mind. Surprisingly, it's not even discussed enough, and fully accepted fact.

"The Hanuman and the Vanar Sena mentioned in the Epic, are not really monkeys in origin but humans beings who wore monkey gear as a self representation of who they are as a jati."

In today's Hindi language, "Vanar/Vanara" means  "Monkey".

But Hindi and Sanskrit have a very interesting way for framing and assigning new ideas and concepts into words. They do this by combining a two or three root words to form new words and meaning. This is something which is done here too,

```
Van + Nar

Forest + Men
```

"Forest Men". Yes, that is the actual meaning of the word - ' Men who resided in the forests'.

The Vanar/Vanara are described as wise, strong and knowledgeable, quite human-like characteristics unlike the monkeys. They had a strong sense of right and wrong. They are further described as amusing, childish, mildly irritating, hyperactive, adventurous, bluntly honest, loyal.

It is also interesting to note that only the male Vanar are represented as monkeys while their female counterparts are presented as normal human women, which only reinforces the fact that they were not really monkeys but they wore protective/identity gear.

Kishkindha - The Kingdom of Vanar is near Hampi in modern day Karnataka, Anjanadri near Hosipet is the birthplace of Hanuman. In the British records of the gazette of Bellary district , which is very near modern day Hampi or Kishkindha of earlier times , it was noted that the forest tribes of that area call themselves Vanar people and used monkey as their symbol in their monumental sculptures and flags. So it is believed that this tribes are the descendants of Vanaras mentioned in Ramayana.

The most popular of them, is Lord Hanuman - the devoted companion of Ram. He has quite a lot of attributes under his belt. He has super human strength, can shapeshift, immortal, a bhakt and a Brahmachari. He is popularly represented as a monkey. 

So, what he would look like, if he is without his monkey gear. I tried finding descriptions of him from different sources and and combined to form a sentences for the algorithm.

> He possessed an extraordinarily radiant personality, commanding attention wherever he went. His tall and muscular frame was complemented by a striking face, crimson red like coral, with a unique aside and curved mouth that added to his allure. His tawny complexion radiated an intensity comparable to lightning, making him appear almost otherworldly.
> 
> Dressed in pristine white garments, his eyes gleamed like refined gold, exuding a sense of wisdom and power. His arms resembled colossal iron maces, suggesting unmatched strength, while his broad shoulders and expansive chest framed a waist that, despite its width, appeared remarkably slender in contrast. Towering above all, he stood as the incomparable and tallest among warriors, embodying both might and majesty.

I fed this information to ChatGPT, and the result ?

Quite accurate to description. Only issue, the guy wasn't a bulky man like the Rock in pseudo Roman attire?

> The person is of south Asian descent in traditional Indian attire

And he gives me this -

Nooo... where is that skin, ...He doesn't look mischievous at all. His eyes look perfect though...
That's not the Indian man I had in mind. He looks like a well fed Indian man brought up in British era, quite unlikely of the one I want to replicate.

Then I thought of taking Sun Wukong as reference. The character from the PS5 game, 'Black Myth Wukong' as a better fitting description. 
Also he is the perfect description of the Vanar.
Did China also had a Vanar/Vanara tribe? Could be likely. His birth origins are quite vague - mostly born in the forest. Blessed or nourished with the five elements - earth, water, air, fire, ether. That,
Let's see if I can humanize him as an Indian man. Might do the trick.

The images are getting _more ridiculous - no where near..._

ChatGPT does not have any proper data or research when it comes to Indian attire of the ancient times. And have they not seen a bulky Indian dude...the whole of Bollywood is filled of them. Seriously...

So my final move was morphing images of the Lord himself to be more human-like. And this was the result...

# Conclusion

The final image of Hanuman is the only one that matches the description the most. 

The tawny skin tone, the tall and muscular frame and the striking face and the clothes. The AI tool has nailed it! 
What it still lacks is the radiance in his eyes, and a combination of piousness and playfulness that is an integral part of him. 

What began as a curiosity over the nature of Hanuman and his kin evolved into a rediscovery of identity, symbolism, and forgotten truths. Stripped of mythic masks and reimagined through a human lens, Hanuman emerges not as a mere monkey-god, but as a towering embodiment of strength, devotion, and purpose—perhaps a noble warrior, whose stories as well as legacy still lingers through generations.

This exploration isn't meant to diminish the divine but to bring the divine closer, to remind us that even legends are shaped by culture, language, and human imagination. And maybe, just maybe, in humanizing Hanuman, we don’t take away from his godhood—we simply understand it better.
