I recently delved into a psychological horror Webtoon called _Melvina's Therapy_, and I found myself binge-reading the entire series again. 

> It's about Melvina, a psychiatrist who appears professional and dedicated at first glance. However, it turns out she is feeding off her clients' past traumas, fears, and paranoia. Under the guise of helping her clients, she torments them into insanity until one of her clients discovers her scam and manages to escape her torture.

While reading, I found myself sympathizing with both Melvina and Bea's pasts, but more so with Melvina.

Melvina suffered immensely when she was bullied as an orphan, a young girl with noticeable grey strands of hair. She felt that nobody in her world would ever love her. When she was sexually assaulted by the one person she believed would be kind to her, it broke her completely. She decided to discard her human self and become the void she is now. She eradicated all those who abused her, but to become completely insentient, she has been removing her fear of dying by vaccinating herself with her clients' traumas.

As for Bea, she saw her mother become dysfunctional after her father abandoned them, forcing her to grow up and take care of the home, a role she despised. Her only decision to enjoy herself for a few hours at a concert led to her mother's suicide. Her guilt and shame stayed with her.

I am currently facing similar situations in my life.

In my late 20s, I feel like I haven't experienced the freedom adults get to enjoy. My hands have been tied ever since I turned 21. I left my postgraduate entrance exams halfway because I had no one to fund my further studies. I worked at a job I didn't want. I took on a caregiving role for a few months when my mother fell sick. With the stress, I never properly upskilled for the next five years. I know no one, have no network, and have never dated. I never got to love or be loved.

My personal rant here doesn't mean I didn't try my best to improve my situation. I managed to get a six-month PG certification. I left my job to focus on further upskilling myself. But now it all feels useless. I feel useless.

As I turn 27 this year, I realize that I have failed in life. I have accepted and made peace with myself. I can't get love, nor do I have the capacity for it. But I am frustratedâ€”why can't I have a selfish, materialistic lifestyle? I don't want to be a mature woman, but the guilt of this selfishness is also eating me. Even from the comfort of my home, where I am writing this, I feel immense pressure. I hate that I have to deal with this tumultuous feeling.

Do I see the silver lining? I am not very optimistic. But I need to move forward with everything I have, no questions asked. I will give an update in about six months. Fate accepted.
