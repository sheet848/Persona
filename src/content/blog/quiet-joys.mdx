There are certain things I love that don’t come up in conversation. Not because they’re taboo or controversial—just… unrelatable. The kind of interests that light up my brain but cause others to blink blankly when I bring them up.

A band whose music I feel in my bones. A show that changed how I see the world. A topic I’ve read obsessively about for years. A piece of art that lives rent-free in my mind.

I don’t talk about these much. Not because I don’t want to—but because no one around me quite _gets_ it.

## When No One Speaks Your Enthusiasm

There’s a unique kind of loneliness in loving something passionately and not being able to share it.

It’s like having this vibrant garden in your backyard and realizing your neighbors don’t care for flowers. You want to show someone the colors, the textures, the way the light hits at 4 PM. But no one ever walks through the gate.

And so you retreat. You stop bringing it up. You become a quiet caretaker of your own joy.

## Internet as Solace, But Never a Substitute

Of course, the internet _tries_ to fill the gap. Reddit threads, Discord servers, niche corners of Twitter—places where you find others who know the thing you know. And for a while, that helps. It scratches the itch to _share_, to argue, to feel understood.

But digital camaraderie is fleeting. You can’t turn to a friend during a walk and go, “You know what this reminds me of?” because they don’t know what you love. They’ve never seen it. They don’t feel it.

And you can’t explain passion in a sentence. Sometimes it’s not even about the thing itself—it’s about _how_ you connect to it.

## Is It Silly to Care This Much?

Sometimes I wonder if I’m being dramatic.

Am I really grieving the absence of conversation about a band, a book, a storyline? But the truth is, it’s not _just_ about the thing. It’s about the desire to be known—to have someone say, “I see why this matters to you.”

To have someone match your curiosity, your intensity. To say, “Tell me more.”

## The Intimacy of Shared Fascination

Some of the most meaningful connections I’ve ever had weren’t built on shared values or life goals—but on shared obsessions. That one anime. That weird science article. That obscure theory. When someone _gets_ the thing you care about? That’s intimacy. That’s home.

And when that doesn’t happen, you start collecting your interests like sea glass—beautiful, but kept in jars no one else opens.

## Holding Space for What We Love

I’m learning to honor these solitary joys. To love them, even if they’re not understood. To let them shape me, even if they never become common ground.

And maybe one day I’ll meet someone who speaks this secret language. Or maybe not. But either way, I’ll keep tending this garden. Keep loving what I love.

Quietly. Proudly. Authentically.

Because some passions aren’t about performance. They’re about presence. Even if no one else is watching.
