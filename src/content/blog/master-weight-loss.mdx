As I finished my day with my apple cider vinegar concoction, here  am in front of my screen typing about my diet goals. I find this important as I continue writing.

I have been regulating my food intake for the past one month as I plan to lose weight seamlessly. I have been successful at it too. But maintaining it after the weight loss is my main criteria. 
_( I gained it all back within 3 years of not really exercising and no diet of course)_

So I have been noting my regular intake in the Healthify app, since it is more targeted towards Indian home food and Indian food brands which are commonly available around me.

I keep a personal target of consuming 1200 calories per day. Also, exercising 15-30 minutes of exercise occasionally(still working on being regular). And I have found some very interesting personal findings:

## Creating a calorie deficit
To lose weight, we need to consume fewer calories than you burn. No matter how much you exercise, if we don't create that deficit, weight loss will not happen.
"80% diet, 20% exercise"
To increase metabolism and body calorie burn, we need to focus on strength training and build muscle.

## Eat protein-rich foods
Protein in your food helps one feel full and satisfied, reducing the likelihood of overeating like,
- Egg (1 piece) : 68cal
- Protein Shake (1 scoop) : 57cal
- Panner Bhurji (0.5 katori) : 78cal
- Home made chicken aloo curry (1 katori) : 159cal
- also tofu, need to learn some recipes

 _and also they are low in calories_

## Choose whole foods
Fruits and vegetables and lentils are nutrient-dense and a variety on your plate can help you feel full.

## Monitor portion sizes
Paying attention to serving sizes and avoid eating from the container or bag. This is more important when you having your main carbohydrates intakes (which has more calories than the proteins), I sometimes tend to have more than needed,
- Rice (1-1.5 katori) : 120.4cal - 181cal
- Rotis (2-3 pieces) : 170cal - 256cal

## Staying hydrated 
Drinking plenty of water can help you feel full and may aid in weight loss.

## Choose your junk food
This is the most important section of this blogpost. 
This is real, one cannot stay away from junk food forever. The special mix of sugar and spice is tempting and I am almost drooling.

- A small 10 rupee pack of Lays chips or Kurkure is almost 254cal -> almost 3/4 of a meal intake
- 25g cube of processed cheese (78cal) has less calories than 
	- a cup of coffee - 185cal
	- a samosa - 200cal
	- one cake of top ramen - 317cal (wth, that's supposed to be a meal)
- My Winkies favourite, Delights Love Bite cake - 860cal (I was so shocked, I having homemade cake from now on)
- I mean ice cream is better than that cake
	- Amul Tricone, Black Currant flavour - 226cal

- This was the most shocking, I couldn't get to have a proper meal, so I opted for a panner stuffed sandwich from a canteen. One sandwich is 382cal (again, a whole meal)

_Choose your calories carefully, people_

## Conclusion
Achieving your weight loss goals requires a strategic approach, blending mindful eating habits with regular exercise. By creating a calorie deficit, prioritizing protein-rich foods, and incorporating whole, nutrient-dense options into your diet, you're setting yourself up for success. Monitoring portion sizes, staying hydrated, and carefully choosing when and how to indulge in junk food are essential steps to maintain your progress.

Remember, it's not just about the numbers on the scale but about creating sustainable, healthy habits that will support your overall well-being. Keep pushing forward and celebrating each milestone, no matter how small. Your journey to a healthier, happier you is well within reach! ðŸŒŸ
