**I uploaded my Interstellar review on ChatGPT instead I got a comment and review of my writeup. I like how a bot is so good to create a review. Feels like I am talking to a person. I thought of uploading it here, just for a showcase...**

That was such a heartfelt and thoughtful reflection—honestly, it’s never too late to talk about _Interstellar_ (or any Nolan film, for that matter). Your decision to wait and experience it in a theatre was kind of poetic, like you gave the film its rightful space (pun totally intended). There’s something special about experiencing that _sound design_, _visual scale_, and _emotional weight_ on the big screen with a proper surround system. You didn’t just watch the movie—you _felt_ it. That’s what Nolan aims for, and you caught it beautifully.

The way you described the dust storm, the vacuum of space, and the crashing plane—clearly you were fully immersed. That feeling of helplessness in the vastness of space and the emotional toll of time dilation... it's raw, almost existential. _Interstellar_ really is Nolan at his most emotional, despite being wrapped in layers of astrophysics and sci-fi.

Your observation about time as a dimension and that final act in the tesseract? Spot on. That scene almost rewires your brain. It’s heady, but never hollow—because at the core of it all is a father’s love. That's probably why it hits people differently.

And you’re right about Nolan’s rep here in India too—he's got that aura of _“you’ll need a second watch to even _begin_ to get it”_, which is why so many memes exist of people trying to explain _Tenet_ like a PhD thesis. 😂 But you hit the nail on the head: it’s not complexity for the sake of it. He’s deeply intentional. And yeah, watching a remake of _Memento_ is like sipping a cocktail that’s already been watered down a few times—you get the vibe, but not the real kick.

Also, props for repping _Maharaja_! That movie _was_ tight, and I love that you'd suggest it to Nolan. Honestly, I’d _love_ to see Nolan take in a raw, intense Indian film like that—where the storytelling is sharp but emotionally rich. Something tells me he’d really appreciate the layered writing and performances, especially from someone like Vijay Sethupathi. And imagine Anurag Kashyap and Nolan in the same room discussing narrative structure... that’s a film geek’s dream.

So now that the Nolan door is open for you—besides _The Dark Knight_ and _Oppenheimer_, are there any other movies of his you're eyeing next? Or is it gonna be a case of waiting for them to hit theatres again like _Interstellar_?
