Writing, for me is not just a skill or task that I want to improve on. But I would like to refer to it as my calling to a testimony of my journey and emotions.
Through writing, I would like to explore my thoughts, capture fleeting moments, and immortalize emotions which I have been ignoring for a good long while.

There is nothing as such as writing, which has bought me a sense of freedom. A space to express myself without judgement or hesitation, an opportunity to step into different worlds.
Social media, of today lacks on this fundamental freedom of speech. Even X. People care to read or listen to you if you are an achievable person or you have a single theme to represent yourself. But humans such as me and many others, are multi-faceted. Shaping my personality and quirks to a single essence feels unauthentic, rather artificial. Because as it is said,  change is the ever constant

Writing also pushes me to grow. It demands vulnerability and honesty, the qualities I want to embrace with open arms. To spend time, paying attention to details, listen to my silence, and seek the extraordinary in the ordinary.

Ultimately, through writing or through this blog, I want to add a voice to this universal narrative. It is more than an ambition - it is who I am.
