Today, I picked up a book titled _Men Without Women_, a collection of short stories written by Haruki Murakami. Previously, I had the pleasure of reading his famous novel, _Kafka on the Shore_, which I thoroughly enjoyed.

In this collection, I read the story _Men Without Women_. The protagonist receives a call from a man who introduces himself as the husband of the protagonist's ex-girlfriend. The husband informs him that his ex had committed suicide in the dead of night. This news shocks our narrator, especially given that the husband thought to share the sad news with him. The protagonist is taken aback by the revelation that his ex had remembered him through all these years. He reminisces about the two years of innocence he spent with her, and those feelings that disappeared along with herâ€”thus he becomes a man without his woman.

Murakami's writing style delves deep into his mind, as if he spends months pondering the same thing, although in a good way. He vividly describes the unfolding drama in his subconscious, capturing those inner turmoils that reside within him.

Personally, I am not very fond of his writing. His characters are often embroiled in their mental battles, which I also noticed while reading _Kafka on the Shore_, with little real-world action. I enjoyed the novel the last time I read it, but if I were to read it again, perhaps I wouldn't enjoy it as much.

This realization has made me reflect on how I have changed over the past few years. I now believe more in taking action rather than musing over my past or my thoughts. Is this a positive change? I am not entirely sure.

While Murakami is not one of my favorite writers, that does not mean I will stop reading his books. I may not enjoy them the same way as before, but I still plan to read his other short stories.
