#### Early Realizations

Not everyone will like you. This is something I learned from a very young age and accepted wholeheartedly. My main social interactions came from school, where I was friendly with everyone and very proactive in group activities. I felt like a part of the group, though I wasn't a necessary part of it. I didn't really care if I was an important part of their lives. I was just there, everything was cordial around me, and I was happy. This approach worked out well until high school.

#### University Experience

Everything changed when I entered university. Here, how you look, where you are from, and what language you speak became very important if you wanted to find your tribe. Two tribes didn't even try to mingle with each other, even in projects. And I stood out like a sore thumb.

#### Struggles with Fitting In

As an ambivert, I tried to mingle with people in my own way, but it was not appreciated. They gave me hollow looks, signifying my presence as unnecessary. I was heartbroken, I won't lie, and I confined myself to my room, watching anime and K-pop and painting sometimes. My interest in extracurriculars died. I wasn't myself anymore.

It was so bad that I had not communicated with anyone in my class, other branches, or even juniors for all four years of my university life. People showed me indifference at all times, and I never knew the reason why.

#### Finding Solace in Unexpected Places

Had it not been for my really good roommates, people who had joined the lateral entry group, and some people who didn't care about this groupism, I might have been completely isolated. I had conversed more with the lady who ran the tiny supermarket, the man who worked in the stationary store, and the brother who sold cold coffee down the street.

#### The Truth Unveiled

Damn, I almost spent four years with tight-shut lips. And a few months before graduation, I finally got the reason for my social rejection. The so-called people were somehow convinced that I was an untrustworthy person because I had associations with someone considered a loose character. Just because I had talked to that person a few times, I got labeled and quietly outcasted for it. Nobody, not even one, inquired about it until the final few months.

#### Post-Graduation Anger and Healing

I graduated with this internal injustice and anger that kept eating me even after university ended and I started working. I had become biased and bitter towards others in the name of protecting myself. I looked into someone's face and assumed this person would hate me, so why be nice? I believed there was nothing to gain from being nice. My personality devolved, and I secluded myself even further. I became even more insecure and acted like someone who didn't even recognize herself anymore.

#### Support and Moving Forward

I kept my roommates as friends and didn't bring a single new soul into my life. I know it's sadâ€”a result of my own actions. I am lucky to have a good, supportive family. I have healed in isolation, and as we are all growing up, our preferences and lives are changing. I don't want to be tied down to the three, although I love them a lot, and I want to move forward.
