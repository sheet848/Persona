I got to watch Interstellar, the other day. It was my first experience with a Christopher Nolan movie. I know I am 11 years too late to even make a commentary on it. But I never expected I would see the movie ticket bookings for it's second time screening in Cinepolis in my city. With nothing in my bucket that day, I booked the tickets with much enthusiasm.  

Books, graphic novels and comics have always been my favourite source of entertainment that it overshadows even watching movies. So I don't frequent to the theatre much, even to this day. 

But Interstellar had been one of the movies, I wanted to watch, but couldn't make the opportunity to. Mostly because I had heard great reviews about this movie for a while (I mean in years). But I have been putting it off (even on purpose), not even watching it on OTT platforms just because I wanted to give this movie, the respect it deserves - **only in theatres**.

I personally am not that informative about filmmaking, neither I am much aware about Christopher Nolan and his movies. In the Indian scene, he is jokingly infamous for creating complicated storylines which he masterfully executes. So well, that the audience in their awe are left in confusion with a how? scratching their brains. I have watched the Hindi remake of the movie, Memento but that movie would have been toned towards Indian audiences. I wouldn't consider watching that as a Nolan's movie.

So with an empty slate, I sat in the theatre, and of course, it definitely didn't disappoint. From the first frame itself, you don't realize almost towards the end of the movie that the interview of the old lady and man in the beginning were our protagonist's daughter and son-in-law. He really did me there with how the stories' future was connected to the present.

The hyper realistic space exploration, the frustration of the characters as time moves on were so real and a humane part of this intergalactic universe. I like how he visualized time as a dimension which we could possibly fabricate in this newly found space he was in. All those adventures to different planets, were once a part of my feeble fantasy. I am a little glad we never got to realize it ourselves.

But what struck me most was the sound design in this movie. When the characters are in the dust storm, I am in there too. When Cooper faces turbulence as his plane is about to crash, planes noises made me uncomfortable and worry momentarily about the crash. When the spacecraft launches and touches space, I could feel the sudden vacuum.
It was an incredible experience overall, and just for this I am so glad that I didn't watch this movie earlier.

I now do get it why Christopher Nolan is the OG in what he does. That also explains the hype that the Dark Knight, Oppenheimer bought when it came to theatres. I will definitely watch these movies when I get the time. But I would wish for them to make a comeback to the theatres (fingers crossed).

Well, if I could suggest him a recent Indian movie - I would recommend him to watch Nithilan Saminathan directed, Maharaja(2024) starring Vijay Sethupathi and Anurag Kashyap. I think he will enjoy this simple movie.

Also he is going to release the Odyssey next year, I will be prompt next year and view the movie when it is in hype. He really did take a huge subject matter to execute. I am curious what is he going to show us.
