You know that one aunty?

The one who knows **everything** about everyone—the cousin who married too fast, the neighbor’s son who dropped out, that one family scandal that somehow resurfaces at every family gathering. She doesn’t even have to ask; she _knows_. And somehow, even when you try to avoid her, she finds a way to drag you into her monologue. Not maliciously, but insistently. Loudly. Endlessly.

That’s what YouTube feels like to me.

I didn’t _intend_ for our relationship to go this way. It used to be fun, even useful. A music video here. A tutorial there. Maybe a 5-minute cooking video or a cute vlog from someone I actually liked.

But now? Now YouTube greets me like that gossip aunty I cross the street to avoid—except I can’t. She’s already at my door, uninvited, autoplaying.

### The Algorithm Is the New Aunty Radar

What freaks me out is how YouTube seems to know the exact emotional frequency I’m on. Did I search “how to set boundaries” once three weeks ago? Suddenly I’m drowning in reels about toxic friendships, narcissistic exes, and why I might be codependent. One late-night binge on productivity? Welcome to a week of “wake up at 5 AM” routines and guys whispering at me over lofi music to _just do the work_.

It's exhausting. It’s like YouTube peered into my digital soul and said, “Sweetie, I noticed your vibe’s off. Let me talk AT you for a bit.”

The thing is—I didn’t ask.

### Information or Intrusion?

There's a line between feeling informed and feeling intruded on. Somewhere along the way, YouTube blurred that line.

What used to be “search-based” has now become “suggestion-based.” And those suggestions don’t always land like helpful nudges—they feel more like someone barging into your space saying:

> “So, I heard you were thinking about quitting your job?”  
> “Did you know your favorite creator might be problematic?”  
> “Here’s what _actually_ happened with that influencer breakup.”  
> “Your skincare routine might be making you age faster, btw.”

It’s relentless. Curated. Chaotic. Intimate in a way that’s unnerving. The gossip aunty never needed my consent—neither does YouTube.

### YouTube Asks for Nothing, But Demands Everything

The wildest part? I can’t look away.

Even as I roll my eyes, even as I sigh and think “Why am I watching this?”, I stay. I click. I listen. I judge. I laugh. I get weirdly emotionally invested in people I will never meet.

And just like that, I’ve spent 40 minutes spiraling through commentary, confessions, exposés, reviews, and live reactions to drama I didn’t even know existed 10 minutes ago.

It’s like being cornered at a wedding reception—plate in hand, sari slightly askew—and being lovingly force-fed gossip you didn’t come for but now somehow have opinions about.

I hate it. I love it. I hate that I love it.

### The Paradox of Parasociality

What makes YouTube unlike any other gossip aunty is that sometimes... I actually care. The creators feel familiar. Their lives, their breakups, their struggles, their “I’m taking a break” videos—they feel like people I know. Or want to know. Or _think_ I know.

But I don’t. I’m not in their group chats. I don’t see the unedited moments. And yet, YouTube serves me their lives on a platter with algorithmic confidence. “Here. You’re gonna want to know this.”

It turns content into a cocktail of parasocial intimacy and performative vulnerability. It blurs my emotional boundaries. Suddenly, someone else’s story is occupying space in my brain where my own thoughts should be.

### Trying to Walk Away

I’ve tried to detox. Tried to curate my feed. Tried to pause the autoplay. But YouTube is like that aunty who knows which temple you go to, what time you arrive, and will catch you outside before you even reach the steps.

Sometimes she’s entertaining. Sometimes she’s wise. Sometimes she reminds you of your own wounds, in ways you didn't ask for.

But most days? I just want to _not be perceived_.

I want silence.

I want to log on without being _dragged into someone else’s emotional ecosystem_.

And yet, here I am. Writing this. Venting about the aunty who’s now a fixture in my living room, my phone, my mental clutter.

### Final Thought

I don’t hate YouTube. I just wish she’d knock first.
